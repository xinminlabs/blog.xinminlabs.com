### 介绍

It was a talk from Lisa Larson-Kelley at Goruco 2014, introducing how to
use WebRTC to implement real time communication on browser.

It introduced the current status of WebRTC

Chrome and Firefox has fully supported WebRTC, Opera supports WebRTC on
desktop, not mobile yet, Safari and IE doesn't support WebRTC yet.

It introduced 3 WebRTC APIs

* MediaStream
* RTCDataChannel
* RTCPeerConnection

It also introduced server side work and some current solutions and
services.

Demos are very interesting, they show you how powerful WebRTC is.
