[octodown][1] allows you to preview what markdown would look like
exactly on github from your shell.

If you are a developer who uses github, you have many chances to write
markdown files, but you can't see what the mardown would look like until
you push it to github, but sometimes when you want to write some formats
you aren't familiar with, like table, you may need to push several tiems
to make it work.

By using octodown gem, you can preview and change markdown formats
locally, dead simple.
