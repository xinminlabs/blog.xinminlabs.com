### Introduction

It was a talk  from Kiyoto Tamura at Golden Gate Ruby Conference 2014,
sharing his experience to do data analysis by fluentd.

He mentioned the problems he faced when doing data collection and logs
analysis, and introduced how to solve them by using ruby and fluentd.

Fluentd adds a middle layer between data sources and data storages, all
data sources are sent to fluentd first, fluentd will format data then
save to corresponding data storages.

The talk also gives a demo, although is's not successful, we still can
see how fluentd works.
